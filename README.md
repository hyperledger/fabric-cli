This repo is going to be used to implement [FAB-10734 Fabric CLI Redesign](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10734).
This is NOT the "official" Fabric CLI and there is not yet any commitment that it is going to be.

# Hyperledger Fabric CLI

The Hyperledger Fabric CLI is a tool used to interact with [Fabric networks](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `make`
3. Locate the binary in the `bin` directory
4. Add the binary to your PATH
5. Execute `fabric` for more information

## Getting Started

1. Add a Network with `fabric network set`
2. Add a Context with  `fabric context set`
3. Use the new context with `fabric context use`
4. You're all set... Have fun!

## Network

A network is a direct reference to a [Fabric-SDK-Go configuration](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/main/pkg/core/config/testdata/config_test.yaml).  This configuration contains all of the necessary details for interacting with a Fabric network at a global scope.

## Context

A context defines the scope for interactions with the network.  An example of this would be: As `Admin`, I want peer `peer0.org1.example.com` in organization `Org1` to join channel `mychannel`.  In this example, the context would include the identity, peer, organization, and channel.

## Built-in Commands

Built-in commands can be found in [/cmd/fabric/commands](/cmd/fabric/commands).  These commands can serve as examples for building future commands like `plugin chaincode install ...`.

## Plugins

Users can create and install custom commands to the Fabric CLI.  The only requirement is that all external commands must provide a `plugin.yaml`.

The YAML must specify:
* Name - command name
* Usage - usage syntax
* Description - short description shown for help
* Command - plugin execution

Example plugins can be found in [pkg/plugin/testdata/plugins](pkg/plugin/testdata/plugins).

For example,if you want to integrate `cryptogen` into `fabric` cmd:

1. Prepare the `plugin.yaml`:
   ```yaml
    name: cryptogen
    usage: cryptogen [<flags>] <command> [<args> ...]
    description: Utility for generating Hyperledger Fabric key material
    command: cryptogen
    ```
2. Exec the command: 
    ```shell script
    #PATH is the location of `plugin.yaml`.
    $fabric plugin install $PATH
    ```
3. To enjoy the command:
    ```
   $fabric cryptogen ...
   ```
You can integrate some **Go Plugins** or **External Command** into **fabric** cmd,
